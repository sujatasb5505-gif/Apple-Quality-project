# Apple-Quality-project
The Apple Quality Prediction System is a machine learning–based project designed to predict the quality of apples based on their physical and chemical characteristics. This system helps farmers, distributors, and vendors quickly classify apples as good or bad, improving quality control and reducing manual inspection effort.
